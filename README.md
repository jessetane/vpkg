A language agnostic, multi-version tolerant package manager.

## Disclaimer
Don't use this. It's just an academic project for teaching myself about package managers and shell scripting.

## Why
I hate the idea that I need a different package manager for every language/platform.

## How
Sourcable shell scripts.

## Install
`curl "https://raw.github.com/jessetane/vpkg/master/package.sh" | bash`

## Usage
`vpkg <command> [options] <package> [<build>] [<version>]`
